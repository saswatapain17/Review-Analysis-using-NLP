# Review Analysis with Naive Bayes Classifier
A sentiment analysis project using a Naive Bayes classifier to analyze movie reviews.
## Installation
1. Clone this repository: "https://github.com/saswatapain17/Review-Analysis-using-NLP"
2.  Install the necessary Python packages using pip:  numpy,pandas
 ## Usage
1. Prepare your dataset (a2_RestaurantReviews_FreshDump.tsv).
2. Run the preprocessing script to tokenize, lemmatize, and split the data.
3. Train the Naive Bayes classifier.
4. Evaluate the model's performance on the testing data.
## Data Preprocessing
- Tokenization: Splitting reviews into individual words.
- Lemmatization: Reducing words to their base form (e.g., "running" to "run").
- Data Splitting: Dividing data into training and testing sets.
  ## Naive Bayes Classifier
- Implemented a Naive Bayes classifier based on Bayes' theorem.
- Used Laplace smoothing to handle unseen words.
